# HK_Hiking_Tail_Summary

# The information of each mountain is on https://www.oasistrek.com/trail_summary.php
# I crawled all mountain information down from this website, where the scenary and level are listed in the form of stars, while the length and time are listed in the form of numbers
# In order to draw the radar chart, I need to divide distance and time into five groups.
